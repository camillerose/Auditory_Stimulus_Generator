# Auditory_Stimulus_Generator
These are MATLAB scripts that create a variety of classic auditory stimuli used in psychology experiments. These scripts are called via a GUI in which the user can choose many aspects of the stimulus he/she wishes to create.

This project was completed so that others in my laboratory could make stimuli for their experiments quickly and efficiently. Users can produce a range of stimuli and can alter many facets of the stimulus. The following types of stimuli can be created:
- pure tones
- varying tonal sequences
- narrowband noise
- broadband noise

Frequency, bandwidth, amplitude modulation, inter-stimulus interval, duration, and repetition can all be varied according to the userâ€™s needs.
